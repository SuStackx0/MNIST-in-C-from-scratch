# MNIST-in-C-from-scratch
This project implements the MNIST digit classification algorithm using the C programming language. It includes:

Manual data loading and preprocessing.
Neural network implementation with forward and backward propagation.
Gradient descent for optimization.
This project is aimed at understanding the core concepts of machine learning, particularly neural networks, in a low-level programming environment.
